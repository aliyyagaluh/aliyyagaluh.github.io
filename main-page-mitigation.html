											<p>Despite the notion that strategic planning to secure a city's water  production is vital to meeting water demands, Cape Town responded late to an impending water crisis that could have easily been stymied by accurate water-security forecasts. Governments need time to conduct appropriate assessment and strategy development for long-term sustainability of new desalination plants [22]. Ergo, proper implementation of current mitigation strategies — such as alternative water production methods, including desalination plants — would require years of planning and construction. Additionally, the water distribution network has to be expanded and upgraded to match the increase in water flow.
