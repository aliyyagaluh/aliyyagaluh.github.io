												Since 2015, the city of Cape Town, South Africa, has experienced a lack of rainfall, which has since turned into a large-scale drought crisis leading to the approach of day-zero [1]. However, due to effective emergency measures such as rationing, day-zero has now been delayed multiple times, eventually landing at some point in 2019 [2]. Although positive, these measures do affect many aspects of daily life for society, as well as many sectors of industry, most notably agriculture. Regarding society, there is a rationing of water to 50 litres per person, per day whether at home, school, or work [3]. Regarding agriculture, crop production meant for local produce and export have both decreased by 20-25%, which leads to a higher dependency on import, less income for farmers, and fewer jobs [4]. 
												</br>
												Scientists expect the frequency, length, and severity of droughts to increase worldwide due to climate change [5]. Over the last fifteen years, Cape Town has experienced a population growth of 38% (from 2,892,243 in 2001 [6] to 4,004,793 in 2016 [7]), and continues to grow. Cape Town will have to anticipate for the changing climate, population growth, and change in the viability of current water resources. Besides investments into new water resource projects and technologies, adaptation to scarcity of water might require a change of society's mindset and attitude towards water consumption. The combination of these factors increase the need for a strong and reliable water supply. Worldwide, there are many cities, including Cairo, Beijing, Jakarta, and Mexico city, that are expected to face similar water-crises [8]. 
												</br>
												This website, aims to give an overview of the proposed mitigation strategies addressing the different levels of the water-crisis in the Western Cape. It furthermore, provides insights in how these approaches can be integrated to facilitate the improvement of water management and the development of a smarter water network in Cape Town. 
												</br>
												A stakeholder analysis describes the current governance and management landscape of the regionâ€™s water sources. There is a clear description of how the various interventions of sources, distribution, usage, and wastewater treatment fit together into a bigger picture. The limitations of the suggested approaches, as well as ethical implications, are also brought to light.

												South Africa has adopted a complex decentralised water governance landscape that aims to include perspectives from all major stakeholders. Decision making for water management is dispersed to increase transparency, and make public needs and interests easily accessible. Therefore, the water supply in South Africa is ensured at three main levels of management: national, provincial, and regional [9]. Figure 2 illustrates this decentralised water management system.
